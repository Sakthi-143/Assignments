### README

This repository contains Python scripts for statistical analysis on various datasets. Each script addresses specific questions or tasks related to descriptive statistics, probability distributions, hypothesis testing, and confidence intervals.

#### Structure:
 
1. **Question 7:**
   - Calculates basic statistical measures (mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, range) for a given dataset.
   - Utilizes Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and calculation.

2. **Question 9:**
   - Part a: Computes skewness and kurtosis for given data columns using SciPy's statistical functions.
   - Part b: Calculates skewness and kurtosis for different data columns.

3. **Question 11:**
   - Estimates confidence intervals for the mean weight of a sample using the t-distribution.

4. **Question 12:**
   - Part 1: Computes mean, median, variance, and standard deviation for a given dataset.
   - Part 2: Provides insights based on the statistical measures computed.

5. **Question 20:**
   - Part a: Calculates the probability of MPG values exceeding a certain threshold and between two values.
   - Part b: Computes the probability of MPG values being less than a certain threshold.

6. **Question 21:**
   - Part a: Analyzes the distribution of MPG data using summary statistics, visualizations, and normality tests.
   - Part b: Examines the distribution of Adipose Tissue (AT) and Waist Circumference data and conducts normality tests.

7. **Question 22:**
   - Computes Z-scores for specified confidence intervals.

8. **Question 23:**
   - Estimates t-scores for specified confidence intervals and sample sizes using the t-distribution.

#### Usage:

- Each script is self-contained and can be executed independently.
- Ensure the required libraries (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib) are installed in your Python environment.
- Run the scripts in a Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab) by following the instructions provided in each section.

#### Note:

- Data files mentioned in the scripts should be available in the same directory or provide the correct file paths.
- Customize the scripts as needed for your specific datasets or analysis requirements.
- For any questions or issues, feel free to contact the repository owner.

Enjoy exploring statistical analysis with Python!
